# MeetUpOTown

MeetUpOTown demonstrates using the Meetup.com RESTful API to retrieve display a list of upcoming meetups in 
the Orlando, FL, area, for the next month. It will initially display the first 20 meetups, and when you 
scroll to the end of the list, will download and display the next available 20 meetups. 
It also saves a 'favorites' list, using NSKeyedArchiver, that can be use to save and display a list of 
your favorite meetups. The favorites list can be rearranged and edited.
